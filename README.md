I have been a telecommunications and electronics engineer for more than 3 years. I am a graduate of Tecnologico de Monterrey and currently work with Ericsson as an integration engineer.

One of my greatest achievements as a professional in Ericsson is having been selected to configure/integrate the telephone and Wi-Fi network at JFK airport.

The world of data caught my attention, specifically the roles such as data analyst or data scientis, so I decided to complete a diploma in data science and AI (https://www.credential.net/e10d2b06-b740-4162-9489-1e65930701b6) to apply on those roles.
