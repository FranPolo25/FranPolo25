I have been a telecommunications and electronics engineer for more than 3 years. I am a graduate of Tecnologico de Monterrey, during my career I made several projects that involved electronic and programming skills.  

I started working with Ericsson in november 2020 as an integration engineer (in charge of the east side of United States of America). This involves tasks such as configure, analize, prepare and program the Wi-fi and telephone network of our client. 

One of my greatest achievements as a professional in Ericsson is having been selected to configure/integrate the telephone and Wi-Fi network at JFK airport. Also I have been recognized many times by stakeholders, co-workers and my boss for the quality of the deliverables.

Let me share a little presentation of who Francisco Polo is and the impact I have made during my journey with Ericsson ▶️ [Francisco Polo.pptx](https://github.com/FranPolo25/FranPolo25/files/12825544/Francisco.Polo.pptx).

The world of data caught my attention recently, specifically the roles such as data analyst or data scientist, so I am looking to apply on those roles.
